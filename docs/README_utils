As you certainly know, the ASCII code didn't exist at the time of
the LGP-30, so the Flexowriter and the LGP-30 didn't use it.

When we read the papertapes, we had to use much more modern equipment
to bring the tapes to our ftp server:
A PDP8/E with a FACIT papertape reader is our working horse to do
the transfer. The both programs FLEX.PA and REFLEX.PA do the translation
from Flexowritercode to ASCII and back. They are written in PDP8 assembler
PAL-8.
Both programs are available here.

From the PDP8 kermit did the rest.

There are two other utilities needed for transferring files between the
LGP-30 and a PC, both are Turbo Pascal programs that can easily be translated
into other languages. The first program is 'flex2asc' that translates
a file from Flexowriter code into ASCII. You need it if you read in a tape
on a PC like I do to produce a readable file either for documentation
or for my LGP-30 simulator. The other program is 'asc2flex' which does the
job the other way round. It is needed in order to produce LGP-30 readable
papertapes from ASCII sources.
